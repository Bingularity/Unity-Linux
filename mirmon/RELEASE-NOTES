All versions of mirmon use the same state file format, config file format
and icon set. You can upgrade safely by just replacing program 'mirmon'.

--- mirmon 2.1 -- 28 jan 2010 ----------------------------------------

o the algoritm to balance the probe load over the hourly mirmon runs
  is improved ; from completely skewed to balanced takes some 5 days.

o mirmon only reports changes in the mirror_list (inserts and deletes)
  unless in quiet mode ; option -v now shows progress when probing.

o added some documentation ; fixed some doc bugs.

--- mirmon 2.0 -- 9 jan 2010 ----------------------------------------

o The code was completely reorganized ; hence the bump in the
  major version number.

o the code is now modularised. The distribution contains 'Mirmon.pm',
  an OO interface for mirmon objects. Program 'mirmon' still contains
  all the code ; it is split into 'Mirmon.pm' and 'mirmon.pl'.

o For Mirmon.pm, html and man (source and formatted) pages were added.

o configuration option 'htm_top' : the supplied text is no longer placed
  between <P> and </P> in the report ; to keep the www validator happy.

o the report is smaller ; html code for the age histogram is improved.

o Formatted man pages (mirmon.txt and mirmon.pm.txt) are now created
  with pod2man and man instead of pod2text.

o program probe passes options -v and -q to rsync and wget.

o documentation : better guidelines in the 'installation' section.

--- mirmon 1.39 -- 24 dec 2009 --------------------------------------

o the mirror list can now have rsync urls like
    rsync://rsync.apache.org/apache-dist/

o the mirmon distro now contains a sample program 'probe' ;
  a simple Perl program for probing ftp, http and rsync mirrors.

o a new directive 'no-add-slash' prevents mirmon from
  adding a trailing slash to urls, when one is missing.

o the distro now contains a mirmon.1 man page source.

o internal note : source management changed from rcs to svn.
